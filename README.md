# ML-2025

This repository contains projects for my Machine Learning lab in 2025.

## Projects

- **K-Folds.ipynb** — My first project implementing K-Folds cross-validation.  
- **MNIST.ipynb** — Classification of handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.  
- **Bayesian Decision Tree.ipynb** — Implementation of a Decision Tree classifier using Bayesian principles.  

More projects will be added as the lab progresses.
